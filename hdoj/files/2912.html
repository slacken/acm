The ray travels in a straight line. When the laser ray from I hits the surface of a sphere at Q, let N be a point outside of the sphere on the line connecting the sphere center and Q. The reflected ray goes to the direction towards R that satisfies the following conditions: (1) R is on the plane formed by the three points I, Q and N,<br><br><img src=../../../data/images/con207-e-1.JPG><br><center><img src=../../../data/images/con207-e-2.JPG></center> <br>After it is reflected several times, finally it goes beyond our observation.
