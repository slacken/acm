There is a graph G=(V, E ) with P vertexs and Q bidirectional edges between the vertexs. Sometimes there are a lot of edges between two vertexs, and all the edges differ from each other. V1 is the first vertex and Vp is the last vertex.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Everytime P player marks a ‘+’ on one of the remained edges which have neither a ‘+’ nor ‘-‘ at all, and N player marks a ‘-‘ on that kind of edges without any marks. At the beginning, N player acts first, and then P player does, and then N player does alternately. The game comes to an  end when all the edges are marked with either a ‘+’ or a ‘-‘.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we give the rules to judge the winner:<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;If there exists a road from V1 to Vp, whose edges are all marked with ‘+’, P player wins the game ultimately. So we can see, P player tries his best to create a such road to win the game.<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;If there exists none such road ,whose edges are all marked with ‘+’ from V1 to Vp, P player losses the game finally. Also we can see, N player does the best to destory that kind of roads described above in rule(1).<br><br>Now give you such a graph, you need to verdict the result whether the P player can win the game. If true, print “Yes”, or “No”.<br></div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Input</div> <div class=panel_content>There are T cases. In the first line of each case, there are two intergers P and Q, P is the number of the vertexs and Q is the number of the edges. Then there come Q lines,each contains two integers v1(1 C P), and v2 ( 1 C P), indicating one edge between the vertex v1 and v2. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;T&lt;=100,2&lt;=P&lt;=30,1&lt;=Q&lt;=1000.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a blank line to separate the adjacent cases.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Output</div> <div class=panel_content>For each case, print the result “Yes” or “No”.</div><div class=panel_bottom>&nbsp;</div><br><div class=panel_title align=left>Sample Input</div><div class=panel_content><pre><div style="font-family:Courier New,Courier,monospace;">2
